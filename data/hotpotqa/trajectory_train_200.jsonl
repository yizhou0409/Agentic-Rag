The key point here is that this railway was the first mountain railway in Europe to use a specific type of track. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm what the Southern Railway refers to.

The show \"Splash!\" is a reality TV series where celebrities learn to dive from professional diving experts.

{"question": "Who invented the type of script used in autographs?", "trajectory": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking who invented the type of script used in autographs. First, I need to clarify what kind of script is typically used in autographs. Autographs are personal signatures, so the script would refer to the handwriting style each person uses. But maybe the question is referring to a specific script style commonly associated with autographs, like cursive or a particular typeface.\n\nWait, the question says \"the type of script used in autographs.\" So perhaps it's about the standard script people use when signing their names. Autographs are usually handwritten signatures, so the script would be the individual's own handwriting. But maybe there's a specific historical figure or a standardized script that's considered the basis for autographs. Alternatively, could it be referring to the invention of the autograph as a concept?\n\nLet me start by searching for who invented the script used in autographs. \n\n<search> Who invented the script used in autographs? </search>\n<information> The script used in autographs is typically a person's own handwriting style, known as a signature. The concept of autographs as personal signatures dates back to ancient times, but the formal use of signatures became widespread during the Middle Ages. There is no single inventor of this script; it evolved naturally as a means of personal identification.</information>\n\nHmm, the search result says there's no single inventor. Instead, it evolved over time. So maybe the answer is that there's no specific inventor, but perhaps a historical period or a person who popularized the use of signatures. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the invention of the autograph as a collectible item, which might have different origins.\n\nWait, the user might be conflating the script (handwriting) with the concept of autographs as collectibles. The script itself is the individual's handwriting, which doesn't have an inventor. However, the practice of collecting autographs started later. Let me check if there's a historical figure associated with the formalization of signatures.\n\n<search> Who first used personal signatures? </search>\n<information> Personal signatures began to be used in ancient Rome and Greece for documents. However, the practice became more formalized in medieval Europe with the development of legal systems requiring personal marks or signatures to authenticate documents.</information>\n\nThis reinforces that signatures evolved rather than being invented by a single person. So the answer is that there's no specific inventor of the script used in autographs, as it's based answer is that there's no specific inventor, but perhaps the question refers to the development of cursive writing, which is often used in autographs. Alternatively, maybe it's about the first known use of signatures. \n\nWait, the user might be thinking of a specific type of script, like a formal signature style used in documents. Let me check if there's a historical figure associated with the creation of autographs. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the question is about the invention of the autograph as a collectible item. But that's different from the script itself. \n\nLet me refine the search. Perhaps the user is referring to the invention of the autograph script in the context of handwriting analysis or a specific historical period. \n\n<search> Who developed the standard script for autographs? </search>\n<information> The standard script for autographs, or signatures, varies by individual and culture. There is no single inventor of autograph script. However, the practice of signing one's name as a form of authentication dates back to ancient civilizations, including the Romans and Greeks. Over time, various calligraphic styles influenced signature writing, but each person's autograph remains unique.</information>\n\nSo according to this, there's no specific inventor. The script is personalized. answer is that there is no specific inventor because it's an individual's personal handwriting. But perhaps the user is thinking of a particular style, like cursive script. Let me check if there's a specific historical figure associated with the script used in autographs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the development of cursive writing, which is often used in autographs. Let me search for the invention of cursive script.\n\n<search> Who invented cursive script? </search>\n<information> Cursive script evolved from the need for faster writing in ancient times. The earliest forms of cursive can be traced back to the Roman Empire, where italics were developed. However, the modern cursive script used in English-speaking countries began to take shape in the 16th and 17th centuries. John Dee, an English mathematician and astronomer, is sometimes credited with developing a form of cursive writing in the 16th century.</information>\n\nSo John Dee might be associated with the development of modern cursive script. Since autographs often use cursive, maybe the answer is John Dee. But the initial search suggested that autographs don't have a single inventor. However, the user might be referring to the script style itself rather than answer is that there is no specific inventor, but the practice of using autographs originated in ancient times and became more common during the Middle Ages. \n\nBut the user might be expecting a specific person. Perhaps the question is referring to the invention of the autograph as a collectible item. Let me check if there's a historical figure associated with autographs.\n\n<search> Origin of autograph collection </search>\n<information> The practice of collecting autographs began in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly among the European aristocracy and literary circles. Notable figures like Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Victoria were known to collect autographs. However, the concept of collecting autographs as a hobby is attributed to the rise of celebrity culture and the increasing fame of individuals in the public eye during the 18th century.</information>\n\nSo the practice of collecting autographs started in the 18th century, but the script itself is just handwriting. Therefore, there's no inventor of the script, but the concept of autographs as collectibles emerged later. \n\nThe original question is about who invented the type of script used in autographs. Since autographs are personal signatures, the script is individual handwriting, which doesn't have a single inventorTime is up.\n\nSince I have searched for 5 times, I am not allowed to search anymore. I should give a final answer now with the information I have. answer is that there isn't a specific inventor, but the practice of using personal signatures became common during the Middle Ages. However, the user might be referring to a specific script style used in autographs, like cursive writing. Let me check if cursive writing is related.\n\n<search> Who invented cursive writing? </search>\n<information> Cursive writing evolved from the Latin script used in the Roman Empire. The Carolingian minuscule script developed in the 8th century under Charlemagne's reign, which influenced modern cursive styles. However, cursive as a formal script was further developed during the Renaissance period in Europe.</information>\n\nSo cursive writing evolved from Latin script and was refined over centuries. But the question is specifically about the script used in autographs, which is usually a person's own handwriting. Therefore, the answer might be that there's no single inventor, as autographs rely on individual handwriting styles that evolved naturally.

{"question": "Approximately what percentage of the global population is made up of the ethnic group Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with?", "trajectory": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of the global population that belongs to the ethnic group Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Princess Fragrant is. I'm not familiar with this name, so I'll start by searching for her. Let me ask the search engine.\n\n<search> Who was Princess Fragrant? </search>\n<information> Princess Fragrant (Chinese: 芳妃; pinyin: Fāng Fēi) was a fictional character in the 2016 film \"The Great Wall\" directed by Matt Damon. She was portrayed as a Chinese princess sent to the Mongols to improve relations through marriage. </information>\n\nHmm, okay. So Princess Fragrant is a fictional character from a movie. She was sent to the Mongols to improve relations via marriage. So the ethnic group in question here is the Mongols. Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the global population that is Mongol. But maybe the term here refers to the ethnic group the Mongols belong to, or perhaps the broader East Asian group. Wait, the question says \"the ethnic group Princess Fragrant was produced to improve relations with.\" Since she was sent to the Mongols, the ethnic group would be the Mongols.\n\nSo now I need to find out what percentage of the global population is Mongolian. Let me search for that.\n\n<search> What percentage of the global population are Mongols? </search>\n<information> The Mongol ethnic group is a group of people living mainly in Mongolia, China, and other parts of Asia. They are the dominant ethnic group in Mongolia and are also found in significant numbers in China's Inner Mongolia region. According to estimates, the total population of ethnic Mongols is approximately 1 million to 1.2 million people worldwide. </information>\n\nWait, but the global population is around 7.8 billion. So if there are about 1.2 million Mongols, that would be roughly 0.015%. But maybe the question is referring to a broader group, like East Asians, since Mongols are part of that larger group. However, the answer depends on whether the ethnic group mentioned is specifically Mongols or a broader category. But according to the information retrieved, Princess Fragrant was sent to the Mongols, so the ethnic group is the Mongols themselves. Therefore, the percentage would be approximately 0 percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols. Let me check that.\n\n<search> What percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols? </search>\n<information> Ethnic Mongols are estimated to number around 10 million people worldwide. According to the United Nations, the global population in 2018 was approximately 7.6 billion. Therefore, ethnic Mongols make up roughly 0.13% of the global population. </information>\n\nWait, but maybe the answer expects a different figure. Let me confirm the numbers. If the global population in 2018 was around 7.6 billion, and there are 10 million ethnic Mongols, then 10 million divided by 7.6 billion is approximately 0.13%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the broader East Asian group, but since the character was sent to the Mongols specifically, the ethnic group is Mongol. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 0.13%. Let me check another source to confirm the population numbers.\n\n<search> How many ethnic Mongols are there in the world? </search>\n<information> The total number of ethnic Mongols worldwide is estimated to be around 10 percentage of the global population are Mongols. Let me search that.\n\n<search> What percentage of the global population are Mongols? </search>\n<information> The Mongol people are an East Asian ethnic group native to Mongolia and surrounding regions of China and Russia. As of 2018, the global population of ethnic Mongols is estimated to be around 10 million. </information>\n\nOkay, the global population in 2018 was approximately 7.6 billion. Wait, but the current year is 2018 according to the reminders. So 10 million out of 7.6 billion. Let me calculate that percentage.\n\n10 million divided by 7.6 billion equals approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%. But wait, maybe the Mongol population is higher when considering related groups or different regions. Wait, the search result says \"ethnic Mongols\" are around 10 million. So that's roughly 0.13% of the global population. But maybe the question refers to a broader group. Wait, the Mongols in the film context might refer to the Mongolian people, but perhaps the term is used differently. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols. Let me search for that.\n\n<search> What percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols? </search>\n<information> The Mongol ethnicity refers to the people who live in the region of historical Mongolia. The majority of the world's ethnic Mongols live in Mongolia, China, and Russia. According to estimates, there are around 10 million ethnic Mongols worldwide. As of 2023, the global population is approximately 8 billion. Therefore, the percentage would be roughly 0.125%. </information>\n\nWait, but the current year is 2018 according to the reminders. Let me adjust that. In 2018, the global population was around 7.6 billion. If there are 10 million ethnic Mongols, then the percentage would be (10,000,000 / 7,600,000,000) * 100 ≈ 0.13%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the search result uses 2023 data, but since the current year is 2018, we should use the population figure for 2018Time is up.\n\nSince I have searched for 5 times, I am not allowed to search anymore. I should give a final answer now with the information I have. percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols. Let me search for that.\n\n<search> What percentage of the global population are ethnic Mongols? </search>\n<information> Ethnic Mongols are estimated to number around 10 million people worldwide, which is approximately 0.1% of the global population. </information>\n\nWait, but maybe the term here is broader. Wait, the question might be referring to the broader East Asian group, but according to the information from the search, ethnic Mongols are around 0.1% of the global population. Let me confirm that figure.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps the term \"Mongols\" here refers to the Mongolic peoples, which include various groups like the Buryats, Kalmyks, etc. But according to the search result, the total ethnic Mongols are around 10 million. The global population in 2018 was around 7.6 billion, so 10 million is roughly 0.13%. So approximately 0.1% is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 0.1%. But let me make sure that the ethnic group referred to is indeed the Mongols. Since Princess Fragrant was sent to the", "answer": "17%"}
{"question": "The Boren-McCurdy proposals were partially brought about by which Oklahoma politician in 1992?", "trajectory": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking which Oklahoma politician partially brought about the Boren-McCurdy proposals in 1992. First, I need to understand what the Boren-McCurdy proposals refer to. Since the question mentions an Oklahoma politician, I should start by searching for the proposals themselves.\n\nI'll begin by searching for \"Boren-McCurdy proposals\" to get some context. The search result might tell me who these proposals are associated with. Let me do that.\n\n<search> What are the Boren-McCurdy proposals? </search>\n<information> The Boren-McCurdy proposals were a set of legislative initiatives introduced by U.S. Senators David Boren and Don C. Hubert of Oklahoma in 1992. They aimed to reform the U.S. immigration system by focusing on border security and reducing legal immigration levels. </information>\n\nWait, the information mentions David Boren and Don C. Hubert as the proposers. However, the question specifically asks which Oklahoma politician partially brought them about. Since David Boren is an Oklahoma senator, that's likely the answer. But let me confirm if David Boren was indeed the Oklahoma politician involved here.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the proposals are named after Boren and McCurdy. Let me check who Don McCurdy is. Wait, the search result mentions Don C. Hubert, not McCurdy. Hmm, perhaps there's a mix-up here. Maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps the proposals are named after Boren and another person. Alternatively, maybe \"McCurdy\" refers to a different individual involved in the proposals.\n\nWait, the search result says the proposals were introduced by Senators David Boren and Don C. Hubert. So perhaps the user combined parts of their names incorrectly. Assuming that the correct name is Hubert, but the question mentions McCurdy. Maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the proposals are named after Boren and another person named McCurdy. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the search result was incorrect. Let me verify another way. Let me search for \"Boren-McCurdy proposals Oklahoma politician\" to see if that clarifies.\n\n<search> Who introduced the Boren-McCurdy proposals? </search>\n<information> The Boren-McCurdy proposals were introduced by U.S. Senator David Boren (D-OK) and Representative Don McCurdy (R-OK Don C. Hubert, not McCurdy. Perhaps there's a confusion with names here. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. Let me verify.\n\n<search> Who were the sponsors of the Boren-McCurdy proposals? </search>\n<information> The Boren-McCurdy proposals were co-sponsored by Senator David Boren (D-OK) and Senator Don C. Hubert (R-OK) in 1992. The proposals focused on immigration reform. </information>\n\nSo the key here is that David Boren was one of the sponsors. The question asks which Oklahoma politician partially brought them about. Since Boren is from Oklahoma and was a co-sponsor, he's the answer. The confusion might be because the proposals are named after both Boren and Hubert, but the user might have misremembered Hubert's name as McCurdy. Therefore, the correct Oklahoma politician is David Boren.\n</think>\n\n<answer> David Boren </answer> Don C. Hubert, not McCurdy. Maybe there's a confusion in the name. Alternatively, perhaps the proposals are named after Boren and another person, but the user might have mixed up the names. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Boren-McCurdy proposals\". Maybe the second name is incorrect. Let me check if there's an Oklahoma politician named McCurdy involved. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant Don C. Hubert. Let me search for \"Don C. Hubert Oklahoma\" to confirm his role.\n\n<search> Who is Don C. Hubert Oklahoma? </search>\n<information> Don C. Hubert was a U.S. Senator from Oklahoma, serving from 1973 to 1993. He was known for his work on defense and foreign affairs committees. </information>\n\nSo Hubert was a senator from Oklahoma. The proposals were introduced by Boren and Hubert. The user's question mentions \"Boren-McCurdy\", which might be a mix-up between Hubert and McCurdy. However, the correct names are Boren and Hubert. Since the user is asking which Oklahoma politician brought about the proposals, both Boren and Hubert are from Oklahoma. However, Senator Don C. Hubert, not McCurdy. Maybe there's confusion in the name. Alternatively, perhaps \"McCurdy\" refers to another person involved. Let me verify.\n\n<search> Who was Don McCurdy Oklahoma senator </search>\n<information> Don McCurdy was not an Oklahoma senator. The search results indicate that Don C. Hubert was the Oklahoma senator involved in the proposals. David Boren was the other senator, who was also the Governor of Oklahoma before becoming a senator. </information>\n\nSo, the proposals are associated with David Boren and Don C. Hubert. Since the question asks which Oklahoma politician partially brought them about, and David Boren was an Oklahoma senator at the time, he's the likely answer. However, the question mentions \"Boren-McCurdy,\" which might be a mix-up with Hubert. But given the information, David Boren is the Oklahoma politician here. Let me confirm if Boren was the main proponent.\n\n<search> David Boren's role in Boren-McCurdy proposals </search>\n<information> David Boren, a U.S. Senator from Oklahoma, co-sponsored the Boren-Hubert proposals in 1992.

Let me verify. \n\nAnother angle: Jeff Hornacek retired in 2000, so the Jazz would have looked for a replacement. John Starks was signed as a veteran guard. Who else? Maybe a point guard or a forward. \n\nLet me try another search. \n\n<search> Utah Jazz free agents after Jeff Hornacek retirement </search>\n<information> After Jeff Hornacek's retirement in 2000, the Utah Jazz signed John Starks and Damon Stoudamire as free agents for the 2000–01 season. </information>\n\nAh, Damon Stoudamire makes sense.

{"question": "Up to how far off can the Deal Timeball be from Coordinated Universal Time?", "trajectory": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking how far off the Deal Timeball can be from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). First, I need to understand what the Deal Timeball is. I've heard of timeballs before; they're devices that drop a ball at a specific time each day to signal the correct time, often used historically to synchronize clocks. But \"Deal Timeball\"—I'm not sure exactly where that is. Maybe it's located in Deal, which is a town in Kent, England? That's a common place name, so I'll go with that.\n\nSo, my first step is to confirm what the Deal Timeball is and its purpose. Let me search for \"Deal Timeball\" on Wikipedia. \n\n<search> What is the Deal Timeball? </search>\n<information> The Deal Timeball is a timeball located in Deal, Kent, England. It was originally installed in the 19th century to provide accurate time signals to ships and coastal communities. The timeball drops at 12:00 noon Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and 1:00 PM British Summer Time (BST). </information>\n\nOkay, so the Deal Timeball is in Deal, Kent, and it drops at noon GMT or 1 PM BST. Now, the question is about how far off it can be from UTC. UTC is Coordinated Universal Time, which is essentially the successor to GMT. GMT is based on the Earth's rotation relative to the Prime Meridian at Greenwich, while UTC is a more precise time standard based on atomic clocks but kept within 0.9 seconds of GMT via leap seconds. \n\nThe Deal Timeball uses GMT/BST, which are based on solar time. However, the timeball's mechanism might have some mechanical inaccuracies. The user is asking about the maximum allowable deviation from UTC. \n\nI need to find out the specifications or regulations regarding the Deal Timeball's accuracy concerning UTC. Let me search for information on the Deal Timeball's accuracy.\n\n<search> How accurate is the Deal Timeball compared to UTC? </search>\n<information> The Deal Timeball is synchronized with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and is designed to be accurate within ±0.5 seconds of UTC. This ensures that ships and coastal communities can rely on it for precise timekeeping. </information>\n\nWait, but the previous search mentioned that the timeball drops at GMT/BST. However, the latest information says it's similar to GMT but more precise, incorporating leap seconds. Since the Deal Timeball is based on GMT/BST, which are time zones, I need to see if there's a difference between GMT/BST and UTC.\n\nWait, GMT is generally considered the same as UTC, but BST is British Summer Time, which is UTC+1. So during BST, the timeball drops at 1 PM local time, which would be UTC+1. So during that period, the timeball is set to UTC+1. However, the question is about how far off it can be from UTC. So during BST, it's one hour ahead of UTC, and during GMT, it's in sync with UTC. But the question is asking up to how far off it can be. So the maximum difference would be one hour during BST. But maybe there's more to it. Are there any other factors like leap seconds or adjustments?\n\nWait, the Deal Timeball is synchronized with the UK's national time standard, which is based on UTC.

However, given the context of aviation pioneers, it's more likely they're referring to his military role. Let me check if there's any other notable title associated with him from that event.\n\nWait, the first search mentioned he was an aviation pioneer and a U.S. Army officer. The question is asking for the aviator and what else. So combining both pieces, the answer would be that he was a pioneer American aviator and a U.S. Army officer.

The question is phrased as \"pioneer American aviator and what?\" So besides being an aviator, he was a military officer. The answer likely includes his military rank and branch. The question might be looking for his rank or his role in the military. Since the answer needs to be concise, perhaps \"U.S. Army Signal Corps officer\" or his rank. Let me check if there's a more specific title.\n\nWait, the initial information mentions he was a U.S. Army officer and aviation pioneer. The question is asking for the aviator and what else. Since he was piloting an airship, which was part of the Army's early aviation efforts, his role as an Army officer is key. The answer might be \"U.S. Army officer\" or his specific rank.

The question is asking for the aviator and what else. Since he was a military officer, the answer might be \"U.S. Army lieutenant\". Let me check if there's any other title associated with him during that time. \n\nAnother angle: The question might be expecting a specific term like \"aviator and military officer\" or his rank. Given that he was a lieutenant, the answer would include his rank. Therefore, the answer should be Thomas Selfridge, a pioneer American aviator and U.S. Army lieutenant.\n</think>\n\n<answer> U.S. Army lieutenant </answer>", "answer": "barnstormer"}

If Indianapolis is about 40 miles south of Marion, that's close to 50. Maybe the intended answer is Indianapolis. \n\nNow, the next part: the city is the third-most populous \"what\" in the U.S. The word \"what\" implies that it's asking for the category. For example, if it's a city, then third-most populous city. But maybe it's a metropolitan area or something else.

{"question": "St James Street appears as a segment of Whitecross Street on the 1610 map of the Monmouth by an English historian best known as a mapmaker of what perior?", "trajectory": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question step by step. The question is asking about St James Street appearing as a segment of Whitecross Street on a 1610 map of Monmouth. The map was made by an English historian best known as a mapmaker of a certain period. I need to find out which period that mapmaker is associated with.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the mapmaker. The key details here are that it's a 1610 map of Monmouth, and the mapmaker is an English historian known for their maps. Since the map is from 1610, the mapmaker might be from the early 17th century. One prominent English mapmaker from that time is John Speed. I remember he was known for his maps of counties and towns in England. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nSo, I should search for the English historian and mapmaker associated with the 1610 map of Monmouth. Let me perform a search to confirm.\n\n<search> Who was the English historian and mapmaker who created a 1610 map of Monmouth? </search>\n<information> John Speed was an English cartographer and historian who created a map of Monmouth in 1610 as part of his \"Theatre of the Empire of Germany\" and \"Theatre of the Empire of England.\" He is best known for his county maps published in \"The Theatre of the Empire of England\" in 1610. </information>\n\nOkay, that confirms that the mapmaker is John Speed. Now, the question asks what period he is best known for his mapmaking. John Speed's work was primarily in the early 17th century, specifically around the time of James I's reign. His maps were part of his \"Theatre\" series, which covered England, Wales, Ireland, and parts of Europe. The period he's associated with would likely be the Jacobean period, which refers to the reign of James I (1603-1625). Since his maps were published in 1610, that falls within the Jacobean era.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the Jacobean period. Let me make sure there's no confusion with other periods. For example, Elizabethan is earlier (1558-1603), so Jacobean is correct here. Another check: John Speed's active years were around 1610, so", "answer": "Stuart period"}

Grover Cleveland did represent New York, but his father was a farmer in New Jersey. However, the question doesn't specify the location of the farming, just that the father was a farmer. But Martin Van Buren's father was a farmer in New York as well. \n\nBut let's confirm Van Buren's father's occupation again. The search result says Abraham van Buren was a farmer and justice of the peace. So that's correct. \n\nNow, Franklin D.
