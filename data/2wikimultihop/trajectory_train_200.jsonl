Then, the question is about her child-in-law. So, Caesar's children would be her children. The child-in-law would be the spouse of one of Caesar's children. Let's think: Caesar had a daughter Julia, who was married to Pompey. But Pompey was Cornelia's husband. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, Julia was Caesar's daughter, married to Pompey. But Cornelia was Pompey's wife. So Julia was Cornelia's daughter-in-law? Wait, no. If Cornelia married Caesar, and Caesar had a daughter Julia, then Julia's husband Pompey would be Cornelia's son-in-law. But Cornelia was married to Caesar, so her children would be Caesar's children. So if Caesar's daughter Julia married Pompey, then Pompey would be Cornelia's son-in-law.

So since Cornelia was Pompey's wife, she was Julia's mother-in-law. Wait, no. If Cornelia married Pompey, and Pompey married Julia (Caesar's daughter), then Cornelia would be Julia's stepmother.

Caesar had a daughter Julia, who died young. Then there's his adopted son Octavian, who became Augustus. But Octavian was adopted, not a biological child. So Cornelia's children would be Julia and perhaps others. But Julia was married to Pompey. So Pompey would be Cornelia's son-in-law.

If Caesar's daughter Julia married Pompey, then Pompey is the son-in-law. But Cornelia's child-in-law would be Pompey. However, I need to confirm this through sources.

So Pompey would be Cornelia's son-in-law. But perhaps there's another child-in-law? Or maybe the question refers to Caesar's other children?
