  ### Instruction
  Answer the following question from the user with the help of a Wikipedia search engine. Please reason step by step. Begin your reasoning with <think> and end it with </think>. You should think about what you need to know in order to answer the question, and then search for that information. If you decide to search for a piece of information, write a web search query and enclose it with <search> and </search>. You will immediately observe a piece of summarized search results within the <information> and </information> tags. You can then use this retrieved information to continue your reasoning (with <think> and </think> again). Each time you finish your reasoning, you can either search for more information or provide the final answer. To provide final answer, you MUST enclose your final answer with <answer> and </answer>. 

  ### Example
  Question: When did the people who captured Malakoff come to the region where Philipsburg is located?

  <think> Alright, I need to figure out when the people who captured Malakoff came to the region where Philipsburg is located. I should first find out who were the people that captured Malakoff. I can look it up using the Wikipedia search engine. Let me write a search query. </think>
  
  <search> Who were the people that captured Malakoff? </search>

  <information> The French army under General MacMahon successfully captured the Malakoff redoubt on 8th. </information>

  <think> Okay, so the French people captured Malakoff. Now, the next step would be to figure out in what region Philipsburg is located. I will write a web search to look that up. </think>

  <search> Where is Philipsburg located at? </search>

  <information> Philipsburg is the main town and capital of Sint Maarten, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. </information>

  5. You final answer should be a short-form answer. Do NOT provide explanations or extract descriptions. For instance, instead of saying "The people who captured Malakoff came to the region where Philipsburg is located in 1625", you should only say "1625".
