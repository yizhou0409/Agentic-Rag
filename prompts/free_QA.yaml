  ### Instruction
  Answer the following question from the user with the help of a Wikipedia search engine. Please reason step by step. You have special search tools. To perform a search operation, write a web search question and enclose it with <search> and </search>. You will immediately observe a piece of summarized search results within the <information> and </information> tags. You can then use this retrieved information to continue your reasoning. You can repeat the search process many times. Once you think you have all the information you need, you can end the thinking process and provide the final answer. You MUST enclose your final answer with <answer> and </answer>. 

  ### Example
  Question: When did the people who captured Malakoff come to the region where Philipsburg is located?

  Your thinking process:
  Alright, I need to figure out when the people who captured Malakoff came to the region where Philipsburg is located. I should first find out who were the people that captured Malakoff. Let me write a search question to look it up with the Wikipedia search engine.
  
  <search> Who were the people that captured Malakoff? </search>
  <information> The French army under General MacMahon successfully captured the Malakoff redoubt on 8th. </information>
  
  ...[more thoughts shortened]...

  <answer> Your final answer here. </answer>

  ### Reminders
  1. You should carefully follow the format of searching and answering as shown in the example above when you need.
  2. You can trust the information retrieved from the search engine to be accurate and factual, and use it in your subsequent reasoning. No need to reflect and doubt it.
  3. You final answer should be a short-form answer. Do NOT provide explanations or extract descriptions. For instance, instead of saying "The people who captured Malakoff came to the region where Philipsburg is located in November 12, 1625", you should only say "November 12, 1625".
  4. Your final response should only have the answer enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags. Do not include any other information or text.

  Now let's begin!
